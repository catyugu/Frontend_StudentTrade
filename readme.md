<h1>Please read the document first before starting developing!!!</h1>
<h2>1. Set up dependencies</h2>
<p>please install the latest version of npm and Node.js to avoid unexpected errors.
Then just run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>npm i
npm run dev
</code></pre>
<h2>2. Structure</h2>
<p>The source code is in the /src folder</p>
<p>/src/App.vue and /src/main.js are respectively the main program and entrance of the program.
Only when you want to modify something globally should you modify these two files</p>
<p>/src/assets are for static resources i.e. icons, css and so on</p>
<p>/src/components are for reusable componentsï¼Œyou may recursively thrust subpages
and subpages into the folder,</p>
<p>/src/utils are other tools used in the program, such as routes</p>
<p>/src/views are for the main pages</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>It is recommended that you use Webstorm to develop the program.
Hmm...and it is easy to find the crack(learning) version of it.:)</p>
